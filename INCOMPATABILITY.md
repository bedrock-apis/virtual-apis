### API Report

This is an autogenerated report. It shows how much tests are not passing from the [bds-docs](./bds-docs/test-runner/suites) test suite with all enabled [VirtualApi core plugins](./src/plugin/core/).

Later this can be used with bapi scan to autogenerate list of apis you may want to implement to fully utilize VirtualApi in your project
