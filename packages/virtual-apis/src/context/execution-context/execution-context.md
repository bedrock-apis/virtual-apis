# Execution Context

The execution context is a crucial component within Virtual APIs, serving as a dedicated environment for each API invocation. It encapsulates all the necessary data and resources required for the API call's lifecycle, ensuring isolation and proper management of operations.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Data Storage:** Holds input parameters, intermediate values, and the final output of the API call.
- **Resource Management:** Provides access to relevant resources, such as the API definition, associated instances, and supporting utilities.
- **Error Handling:** Facilitates error tracking and reporting during the API execution.
- **Isolation:** Ensures that each API call operates in its own isolated context, preventing interference between concurrent invocations.

**Importance:**

The execution context enables Virtual APIs to maintain state, manage dependencies, and handle errors effectively. By providing a well-defined and isolated environment for each API call, it contributes to the overall stability, reliability, and maintainability of the system.
